# 🎬 Movie Recommendation Model

A machine learning-based **Movie Recommendation System** built using collaborative filtering and/or content-based filtering techniques. This project suggests movies to users based on their preferences, viewing history, and similarity with other users/items.

---

## 📌 Features

* Provides personalized movie recommendations.
* Implements machine learning techniques for better accuracy.
* Works with datasets containing user ratings and movie metadata.
* Scalable and adaptable to different datasets.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Movie-Recommendation-Model.git
   cd Movie-Recommendation-Model
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Open Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Run the notebook `Movie_Recomendation_Model.ipynb`.

## 📊 Dataset

* The project can work with **MovieLens dataset** or any dataset containing:

  * User IDs
  * Movie IDs
  * Ratings
  * Optional: Movie metadata (genres, descriptions, etc.)

👉 Download dataset (example): [MovieLens 100k Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)

---

## 🚀 Usage

* Load the dataset in the notebook.
* Train the model on user ratings.
* Generate recommendations for:

  * A specific user (personalized)
  * General top-rated movies
* Evaluate the performance using RMSE, Precision, Recall, etc.

Example:

```python
# Get top 10 recommended movies for User ID = 42
recommend_movies(user_id=42, top_n=10)
```

---

## 📈 Results

* The system recommends movies based on user similarity and/or item similarity.
* Achieved promising accuracy on test datasets.
* Visualization of recommendations and similarity metrics included in the notebook.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Deploy as a **web app** using Flask/Django/Streamlit.
* Add **hybrid recommendation system** (collaborative + content-based).
* Integrate **deep learning models** for better performance.
* Enable real-time recommendation with APIs.
